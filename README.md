This project aims to predict the Salary of Developers in various countries. Features such as Country, Years of Experience, Educational background or level, and remote, hybrid, or On-site role would be used to determine the salaries. This model can be instrumental to both developers seeking out opportunities and also for Hiring managers looking to get their next talent.
